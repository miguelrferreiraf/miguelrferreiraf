# Hello there! <a href="https://www.gautamkrishnar.com/"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="6%"></a>

## My name is Miguel Ferreira and I'm a **web/desktop developer** and **data scientist**.

I have familiarity with most of **Python technologies** of **machine learning and data science** but my most important tool is my capability to link different fields of knowledge in a engaging algorithm. My interests include:

- 📊 Machine learning, IA and its implications 📉
- ➗ Mathematics for machine learning and data science
- 📚 Philosophy, history and why world is what it is 📖
- 🏊‍ Swimming, chess (not specifically well played)
- 🌎 Nature and how it defines us at all ☀️🌊

  <br/>
  
- **Nature affects me** 🌳🌋.
  
  <div align="center"><img src=img/IMG_20220828_174601_015.jpg width=50%><p><i>Pic I took. Going home at dusk.</i></p></div>
  
I love **nature**. That's why I chose _The wanderer above the sea of fog_ to open my overview 🎨. It's the epitome of the romantically nature affected man. With romantic I mean not traditionally romantic, like Titanic or Romeo and Juliet, but romantic by thinking over our place in world.

- **Machine learning beyond it's definition** :exclamation::exclamation::boom:.
  
  <div align="center"><img src=img/Capturar.PNG alt="Deep learning for image recognition"><p><i>LSTM Neural Network with ReLU activation function for image recognition</i></p></div>
  
I really think deeply not only over the problems machine learning can solve for humanity and how it will change work. But I think too about philosophical implications 🤔. What their learning process can teach us about ours? What should we to do to improve their capacity of understanding the world? What lesson should a IA singularity take?

  <div align="center"><img src=img/naked_neuron2.PNG><p><i>ReLU activation neurons nodes. As you can see, it's a sequence of linear function sums.<br>The L in ReLU goes for linear.</i></p></div>
  
        
- **Philosophy and religion** 🙏✝️⛪
  
  <div align="center"><img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8c/Mircea.eliade.jpg alt="Mircea Eliade"><p><i>Gigachad</i></p></div>
  
The guy in photo is ***Mircea Eliade***, the greatest mithologist and comparative religion researcher of sec. XX. His invetigations regarded of why do we think, act and behave like we do. Why do we constitute culture, sing 🎵, paint 🖌️ or dance 💃? You may not understand why this has anything to do with programming but we haven't never in history been so distant from the things that turns us humans, **for the codes we're programming are now programming us**.  
  
That's why I really love studying religion, culture and history. It turns me even into a better programmer. For I'm worried what we could reach with our progress and what may we lose.
